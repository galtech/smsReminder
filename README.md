# smsReminder
### A simple SMS appointment or event reminder

This is a simple script to send appointment or event reminders using the Twilio API. 
Your accountID and token can be added to your environment variables and referenced in the 
code as I have done. 

Names and phone numbers can be stored in a CSV. You may use the sample file I have included as a guide.
